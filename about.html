	<h2>Hi. We're Rivet.</h2>

	They say you meet some of your best friends in life in college; that's exactly what we did. Three generations of RA-resident friendships led to us. Rivet.

	<h2>Our Story</h2>

	A long time ago, in a hospital not too far away, future team Rivet (just Connor, Mitch, Matt, and Kevin) were waiting for Kyle (future Rivet lead developer) to get his X-rays back from an unfortunate hand injury. We spent the entire wait talking about the weird ways people come together. As we began to think more about our relationships, we started to develop a new way for people to meet -- Rivet. We didn't know it then, but our little idea would turn into a company. 

	<h2>From Idea to Product</h2>

	Once we knew we wanted to commit to our idea, we brought on David and Josh. Months of late nights, coffee, and junk food pushed us through design, coding, and marketing. We officially became a company in the state of Georgia and were ready to get going. We had our idea, our company, and our product, then we just needed you. We decided we wanted people to get to know us -- that's when we made our <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/741212464/rivet-social-app?ref=nav_search">kickstarter campaign</a>. Follow the link to learn more about how everything came together!

	<h2>Top-Tiered Backers:</h2>

	We had so many generous people fund our idea. With the help of friends, family, and complete strangers, we made our fundraising goal. Our kickstarter campaign and final product would not be possible without generous contributions from our highest tiered backers:
